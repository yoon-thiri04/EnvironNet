##  Demo

[EnvironNet Demo](https://environnet.streamlit.app/)

---

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/environnet.git
cd environnet
````

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Streamlit app locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> Note: The live webcam feature works only on local devices, not on Streamlit Cloud.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Home Page:** Overview of EnvironNet and project goals.
2. **Upload Photo:** Upload an image from your device or select from demo images.
3. **Take Photo:** Use your device camera to capture a new image (mobile only).
4. **Live Webcam:** Real-time classification using webcam (local only).
5. The app shows **top-3 predicted classes** with probabilities for each image.
